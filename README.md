This is my submission for Computing in the Classroom (2024-25) at the University of Edinburgh

The files consist of a worksheet and python files runnable in the [online micro:bit python editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3/project), as well as sample solutions, for a set of list exercises motivated by music theory
